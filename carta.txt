Letter to Dana â€“ Sonata Arctica

Dana, my darling, I'm writing to you
'Cause your father passed away, it was a beautiful day
And I don't want to bother you anymore
I used to hope you'd come back
But not anymore, Dana

My eyes might have betrayed me, but I have seen
Your picture on the cover of a filthy magazine
And I think my heart just cannot handle that
Dana, my darling, would be so bad

Dana, my darling, I'm writing to you
'Cause your mother passed away, it was a really rainy day
And I didn't mean to bother you anymore
Your mother wished: Come visit your father's grave, Dana

Your father disowned you 'cause you have sinned
But he did forgive you in condition he was in
And I hope you won't do those things anymore
Dana, my darling, I'm waiting for

Little Dana O'Hara oh, Dana, my dear
How I wish that my Dana was here
Little Dana O'Hara decided one day
To travel away, faraway

No, you can't surprise me anymore
I've seen it all before
But it seems I cannot let you go
Dana, Dana, Dana, Dana

And I think that I told you, I'd wait for you forever
Now I know someone else's holding you
So, for the first time in my life - I must lie
Lie is sin, mess that I'm in
Love is not the thing I feel now
I promise you: I won't write again
'Til the sun sets behind your grave

Dana, oh, Dana I'm writing to you,
I heard you passed away it was a beautiful day
I'm old and I feel time will come for me,
My diary's pages are full of thee

Little Dana O'Hara oh, Dana, my dear,
How I wish that my Dana was here
Little Dana O'Hara decided one day
To travel away, faraway

Little Dana O'Hara oh, Dana, my dear,
How I wish that my Dana was here
Little Dana O'Hara decided one day
To travel away, faraway

Little Dana O'Hara oh, Dana, my dear,
How I wish that my Dana was here
Little Dana O'Hara decided one day
To travel away, faraway
